** Compile time errors **

* Problems compiling pindel on OS X * /
* "fatal error: <omp.h> file not found"

For speed, Pindel uses the openmp-library to allow multithreaded performance.
However, OS X does not seem to support openMP in general.

This problem can be tackled by applying the following steps:

1) check if you have homebrew installed on your computer
   [if you don't know whether you have homebrew, just type the command for
   the next step, "brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib". If brew is an
   unknown command, you need to install it.]
   To install homebrew, google "homebrew", or go to http://brew.sh/, or use
   the ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" command.

2) Ensure you have a proper gcc installation with multilib, by using the 
   following command:
   "brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib"

3) Allow pindel to use the real GCC (of homebrew), instead of the 'fake' gcc
   which is default for OS X, by going to pindel/src and using

   make clean
   make CXX=g++-4.9
   [or any other number than 4.9, just whatever your homebrewed gcc version
   number is]

** Runtime problems **

* Memory usage of Pindel is very high *

The most common reason for high memory usage of Pindel is that Pindel tries
to process the centromer regions, which contain lots of 'weird' reads. In such
cases, it is best to use the -j or -J options to specify which chromosomal
regions should be searched by pindel (-j) or skipped (-J). Note that in some
cases you may need to extend the excluded regions a bit (by 10k or such), as
pindel by default also checks for reads just outside the edges of the 
officially specified regions, so you may want to slightly enlarge your 
centromers, telomers or other problematic regions.

The window size option (-W) can also reduce memory usage, which can be needed
for very large data sets.
