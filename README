== Compiling ==
To compile Pindel you need GNU Make, GCC and cppcheck. Usually they are already
installed on Linux. On the Mac you will need to install XCode (3 or higher),
the latest version can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. cppcheck can be
installed with Fink, MacPorts or Homebrew, where homebrew is more convenient if
you don't need to install other software from source.

Pindel requires samtools, you can download the latest version of samtools from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/, you need to extract and build
samtools before you compile Pindel. Refer to the documentation of samtools for
the requirements to build samtools.

To build pindel you must specify the location of samtools on the make
commandline with the SAMTOOLS= option.
For example if you extracted and built samtools in the samtools-0.1.16 directory
in your home directory you will specify:

make SAMTOOLS=~/samtools-0.1.16

If you do not specify SAMTOOLS on the commandline it will default to the
directory samtools-0.1.16 in the top directory of the Pindel project.
