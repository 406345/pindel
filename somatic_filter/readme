This is the initial implementation of somatic indel filtering for Pindel indel calls based on ICGC DREAM challenge round 3 test result. Please advice. contact kye@genome.wustl.edu

step 1: extract indel summary lines using
grep ChrID pindel_output_D > D.head
grep ChrID pindel_output_SI > SI.head

step 2: run provided the perl script with updated configure file
perl somatic_indelfilter.pl  somatic.indel.filter.config

Somatic indel calls will be stored as vcf in the file specificied in our configure file.

We assume normal-tumor paired genome runs by pindel and normal sample come first in the pindel output file.
